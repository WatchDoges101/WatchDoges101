😊 Hello all! I am Joseph Bittner, aka WatchDoges101, an IT help desk technician with a bachelor's degree in information systems and technology with +1 year of professional experience and over 10 years in private learning experiences.

🙋 T-Shaped profile, although Backend is my core expertise, I can bring value as well in other areas such as Frontend, and UI/UX. Product-focused, my main goal is to solve problems and create professional looking user interface and designs. I always try my best.

🧑‍💻 My main technical knowledge involves technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, PHP, and eventually the laravel framework.

✨ Diversity in the tech industry is very important to me, as well as mental health awareness, and accessibility.

🧘 When I'm not working, I like to learn new technologies and programming languages, create artwork using the Adobe suite, and help people with their technological needs.
